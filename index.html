    <!-- This section contains the elements representing specialty services offered by the company. Renamed from "content" to "services" to be more specific to this. -->
    <section class="services">

        <!-- For these three divisions within this section, removing the class tags and leaving only IDs requires editing of the CSS to ensure that the elements within behave properly. I adjusted the img tags in the CSS to reference their respective IDs instead of classes, and the h2 tags were consilidated into one class for brevity since they are all intended to have the same styling.-->

        <!-- Added ID tag so that header link properly directs to this section. Removed individual class tag as the ID will serve the function more appropriately. -->
        <div id="search-engine-optimization">

            <!-- Added alt tags to this image and the two below as well -->

            <h2>Search Engine Optimization</h2>
            <p>
                The dominance of mobile internet use means that users are searching for the right business as they travel, shop, or sit on their couch at home. Search Engine Optimization (SEO) allows you to increase your visibility and find the right customers for your business.
            </p>
        </div>

        <!-- Similarly removed class tag as only ID tag is necessary here, and fixed in CSS accordingly -->
        <div id="online-reputation-management">
            <img src="./assets/images/online-reputation-management.jpg" class="float-right" alt="Reputation expert image"/>
            <h2>Online Reputation Management</h2>
            <p>
                The web is full of opinions, and some of these can be negative. Social media allows anyone with an internet connection to say whatever they want about your business. Online Reputation Management gives you the control over what potential customers see when they search for your business.
            </p>
        </div>

        <!-- Again removed redundant class, leaving only the ID. -->
        <div id="social-media-marketing">
            <img src="./assets/images/social-media-marketing.jpg" class="float-left" alt="Social media tableau image"/>
            <h2>Social Media Marketing</h2>
            <p>
                Social media continues to have a sizable influence on buying habits. Social media marketing helps you determine which platforms are suited to your brand, using analytics to find the right markets and increase your lead generation.

            <h3>Lead Generation</h3>
            <img src="./assets/images/lead-generation.png" />
            <p>
                Inbound strategies for lead generation require less work for your business, bringing customers directly to your website.

                Users find your business through paid and organic searches, increasing the search ranking and visibility for your business.

            <h3>Cost Management</h3>

            <p>
                As the search ranking for your business increases, your advertising costs decrease, and you no longer need to advertise your page.
