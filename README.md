## Technologies Used
* [HTML](https://www.w3schools.com/html/) to structure the "skeleton" of the webpage and its elements
* [CSS](https://www.w3schools.com/css/) for visual styling to make that HTML much prettier
* [Git](https://git-scm.com/) for distributed version control, tracking changes over time and making them visible to collaborators
* [Github](https://github.com/) for version control in the cloud, saving my changes and presenting them clearly to myself and others.

## What I Did
For this project I have refactored the code for a single HTML webpage that represents a fictional company's home page. The HTML and CSS initially provided for the site were mostly functional, but included improper HTML semantics, broken links, inefficient and repetitive syntax, and a lack of comments describing code functionality. In the process of refactoring the code to amend these errors, I have improved the codeblock's adherence to accessibility standards so that the site is better suited for SEO, or search engine optimization.

## Acknowledgments
* [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) has been my go-to for descriptive tutorials on both HTML and CSS functionality, syntax, and best practices. For that I am grateful.
* UC Berkeley Coding Bootcamp provided the initial code to be refactored.
