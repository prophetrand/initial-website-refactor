# Initial Website Refactor - Horiseon

## Description
Welcome! For this project I have refactored the code for a single HTML webpage that represents a fictional company's home page. The HTML and CSS initially provided for the site were mostly functional, but included improper HTML semantics, broken links, inefficient syntax, and a lack of comments describing code functionality. In the process of refactoring the code to amend these errors, I have improved the codeblock's adherence to accessibility standards so that the site is better suited for SEO, or search engine optimization.
